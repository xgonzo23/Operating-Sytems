Since 2015 I have used macOS operating system. Apple has made all of thier product compatible with other products thus making it easy to share files, photos and videos. Th fuction used to share so easily is AirDrop, which makes it easy to use and efficient. 
MacOS has a simplistic interface. The interface makes it easy to navigate and find any app, file or program you may be looking for. This is a huge benefit and less tedious for Window users to convert.
